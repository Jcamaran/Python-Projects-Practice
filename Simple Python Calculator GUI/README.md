This a simple calculator program I created using Python and the tkinter library. 

Calculator Features:

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Parentheses support for complex expressions.
Error handling for invalid input.

How to Use:

Enter numbers by clicking the corresponding digit buttons.
Use operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
Parentheses buttons allow you to group expressions.
The '=' button evaluates the expression, and 'C' clears the input.

Some things i learned by doing this mini project:

- tkinter: The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is built using the tkinter library.
- Event Handling: Buttons trigger functions like add_to_calc, eval_calc, and clear_field.
- Text Widget: The text_result widget displays the input and output.
- Error Handling: The try-except block handles errors during evaluation.

Using enumerate:
- enumerate is used to loop through the list of operators (+, -, *, /).
- It provides both the index and value during iteration.
- Helps dynamically place operator buttons in the GUI based on the index.
